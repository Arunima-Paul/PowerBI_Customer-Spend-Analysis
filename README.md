Here is the analysis of Mitron Bank's customer data with sample of 4,000 customers across five major Indian cities. This analysis will inform our recommendation for a new credit card line.
First let’s see the problem statement. Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They want to introduce a new line of credit cards, 
aiming to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market. This analysis is expected to guide them in tailoring the credit cards to customer needs and market trends.

Data modelling is done between 2 tables and then 2 dashboards are built.

Customer Demographic Dashboard- The dashboard shows 4,000 total customers with more males (2,597) than females (1,403), having an average monthly spend of approx. ₹132.72K. 
Most customers are from Mumbai (1,078), work in IT (32.35%) and belong to the 25-34 age group (37.45%) with a majority being married.

Spend Analysis Dashboard –In this dashboard spending pattern of Customers is analysed. 
Customers have a total spend of ₹531M with an average monthly spend of ₹132,720 per customer. Their total income amounts to ₹207M, with an average monthly income of ₹51,660.
What's striking is the spend-to-income ratio of 2.58 , it means that if a customer has ₹50,000 monthly income, he/she is spending 2.58 times more per month i.e. ₹129,000 per month (50,000 × 2.58). 
This suggests that customers might be using credit extensively, they may have additional income sources which are not captured in the dataset, 
or could be accumulating debt. It presents both an opportunity and risk factor.
